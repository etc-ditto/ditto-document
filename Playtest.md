### 5 Paper Prototypes

In Week 3 we invited fellow classmate and EA individuals to play each of the early 5 prototypes and ask for their opinions. Also, during the quarters we had 7 guests coming from EA who evaluated our one-page design document and gave detailed feedback.<br>
The following are our conclusion:

1. Think about State Share as the core mechanism. Many of our ideas are fun conceptually but also replaceable because State Share only serves as a way to transfer limited in-game status, which is not we want.
2. Differentiate State Share from online multiplayer feature. We need to think if the prototype also works or even feels better under online simultaneous multiplayer structure. If it is, then it's probably not a good design for State Share.
3. Be careful about the theme. Our game need to respect user's privacy and their taste for a "normal" game since our game is targeted for streaming community such as Youtube streaming.
4. Replayablitity. This is also a problem with regard to our target demographic. In this respect, puzzle games have the biggest issue so we opted out of making a puzzle game.

### Virus vs. Cell

State Share leverages cloud game hosting to enable players to share a complete game state instantly with their friends or to the public. It allows you to take 30-second snapshots of your current game’s state and share them online to whoever you want, allowing anyone the ability to “jump” directly into that specific instance of your game. Here’s a [link](https://stadia.dev/blog/the-magic-of-state-share-explained/) to Stadia’s blog on the subject.

### One Hour One Life

The design goal of this was to enable new kinds of games that rely on sharing game states, facilitating complex game system designs that are inherently viral and require elaborate player cooperation across massive scale audiences.

<h5 style="text-align: center;">People testing 2 of our 5 prototypes in week 3.</h5>

In Week 3 we invited fellow classmates and EA individuals to play each of the early 5 prototypes and ask for their opinions. Also, during the quarters we had 7 guests coming from EA who evaluated our one-page design document and gave detailed feedback.<br>
Following are the takeaways:

1. Think about State Share as the core mechanism. Many of our ideas are fun conceptually but also replaceable because State Share only serves as a way to transfer limited in-game status, which is not we want.
2. Differentiate State Share from online multiplayer feature. We need to think if the prototype also works or even feels better under online simultaneous multiplayer structure. If it is, then it's probably not a good design for State Share.
3. Be careful about the theme. Our game need to respect user's privacy and their taste for a "normal" game since our game is targeted for streaming community such as Youtube streaming.
4. Replayablitity. This is also a problem with regard to our target demographic. In this respect, puzzle games have the biggest issue so we opted out of making a puzzle game.

### Virus vs. Cell

We ran a playtest in week 7 just before the halves to make sure our design really highlights the State Share and feels good.

### One Hour One Life

We also ran a playtest in paper form for One Hour One Life idea.

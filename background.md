### What is Stadia?

Stadia is a cloud gaming service operated by Google that offers players the ability to play games at 4K resolution with 60 fps all from the comfort of their personal devices (whether that’s their smartphone or their laptop). Aside from allowing people to play games remotely, Stadia has many unique features that seek to also bridge the distance between streamers and audience such as the Crowd Play feature, which will allow streamers to create virtual queues for their audience to join games with them.

### What is State Share?

State Share leverages cloud game hosting to enable players to share a complete game state instantly with their friends or to the public. It allows you to take 30-second snapshots of your current game’s state and share them online to whoever you want, allowing anyone the ability to “jump” directly into that specific instance of your game. Here’s a [link](https://stadia.dev/blog/the-magic-of-state-share-explained/) to Stadia’s blog on the subject.

### What is our design goal?

The main design goal of this was to discover game concept that uses sharing game states as an important mechanism, facilitating game system designs that are inherently viral and require elaborate player cooperation across massive scale audiences. We also hope our game could attract a large range of players to join Stadia.

### What are the expected deliverables?

Our project is a discovery project, meaning we are mainly focusing on research and prototyping, and for the first half of the semester our goal was a playable prototype as the proof of concept. Given the chance of pitching our game to Stadia, for the second half of the semester our deliverable pivoted to developing a complete game concept for our client to pitch internally in Stadia!

Of course, this design documentation is still one of our deliverables.

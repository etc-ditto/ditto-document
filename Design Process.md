# Design Process

## Design Process covers the whole iterative stages from researching to production.

1. [Research](#research)
2. [Ideation](#ideation)
3. [Paper Prototype](#paper-prototype)
4. [Digital Prototype](#digital-prototype)
5. [Production](#production)

## Research <a name="research"></a>
The main purpose of researching is to get the knowledge of Stadia and State Share and figure out several possible usage situations.<br>
There are a few good resources that we refer to: the first is [Stadia's development blog](https://stadia.dev/blog/the-magic-of-state-share-explained/) where we can have a broad view of what State Share is capable of and several possible use situation.

## Ideation <a name="ideation"></a>
During ideation phase we specify the genre that fits the situations mentioned in our research. Our approach is to think at a higher level and try figuring out the large genre possible for State Share. There are 10 scenes that we think could be possible for implementing State Share. <br>
We talk about each scene for its feasibility, novelty and how close is State Share related to the theme, and we choose five categories to move on to the theming stage: geographic/location-based, community-based coop, asymmetric multiplayer, time travel/version control, transition between devices. We plan to make one paper prototype for each.

## Paper Prototype <a name="paper-prototype"></a>
After narrowing down ideas, we begin making paper prototypes and do playtest both internally and with naive guests. This iteration phase is helpful to solidify our ideas.<br>
We make one page design document for each idea to better illustrate the conception to the audience, especially for those who are not familiar with Stadia. We eventually built 5 paper prototypes as following:
Sharing Part of the Information (Photo Leap, Haunted House): like most multiplayer games, the game delivers the result to all players.<br>
Geographic/ location-based Multiplayer (Animal Inn)<br>
State Tagging (Bomb Express): Delivering the state to the next player after a time period.
Shortcoming: It is also doable using online multiplayer framework.<br>
The shortcomings of some of our ideas is that they are not fully using the feature of State Share: recording complete progress and carry a bunch of information. And we need also to think about the replayability and theme and privacy problems.

## Digital Prototype <a name="digital-prototype"></a>
By halves we are still making digital prototypes. After we narrow down ideas into two big categories, we are able to begin making one digital prototype for each category. The major point of making digital prototypes:<br>
 1. Some ideas are hard to paper prototype, even for those paper prototype-able ones it does not wholly match the feeling we want. <br>
 2. Digital prototypes offer insights into controlling and feedback which paper prototype cannot give. <br>
 3. As the project progresses, we need to settle down on art style, hardware as our final deliverable will be a digital game, so it is good to start early exploring possible approaches for the ideas. <br>

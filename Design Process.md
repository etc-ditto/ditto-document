# Design Process

## Design Process covers the whole iterative stages from researching to production.

1. [Research](#research)
2. [Ideation](#ideation)
3. [Paper Prototype](#paper-prototype)
4. [Digital Prototype](#digital-prototype)
5. [Production](#production)

## Research <a name="research"></a>

The main purpose of researching is to get the knowledge of Stadia and State Share and figure out several possible usage situations.<br>
There are a few good resources that we refer to: the first is [Stadia's development blog](https://stadia.dev/blog/the-magic-of-state-share-explained/) where we can have a broad view of what State Share is capable of and several possible use situation.

## Ideation <a name="ideation"></a>

During ideation phase we specify the genre that fits the situations mentioned in our research. Our approach is to think at a higher level and try figuring out the large genre possible for State Share. There are 10 scenes that we think could be possible for implementing State Share. <br>
We talk about each scene for its feasibility, novelty and how close is State Share related to the theme, and we choose five categories to move on to the theming stage: geographic/location-based, community-based coop, asymmetric multiplayer, time travel/version control, transition between devices. We plan to make one paper prototype for each.

## Paper Prototype <a name="paper-prototype"></a>

After narrowing down ideas, we begin making paper prototypes and do playtest both internally and with naive guests. This iteration phase is helpful to solidify our ideas.<br>
We make one page design document for each idea to better illustrate the conception to the audience, especially for those who are not familiar with Stadia. We eventually built 5 paper prototypes as following:
Sharing Part of the Information (Photo Leap, Haunted House): like most multiplayer games, the game delivers the result to all players.<br>
Geographic/ location-based Multiplayer (Animal Inn)<br>
State Tagging (Bomb Express): Delivering the state to the next player after a time period.
Shortcoming: It is also doable using online multiplayer framework.<br>
The shortcomings of some of our ideas is that they are not fully using the feature of State Share: recording complete progress and carry a bunch of information. And we need also to think about the replayability and theme and privacy problems.

## Learnings

We got a lot of valuable information from our client, faculty advisors and playtesters. Here is the three criteria that we think as the key to a (potentially) successful State Share game:

1. Asymmetrical gameplay is suitable for streamer and audience and well conveys State Shareâ€™s idea.
2. Having a persistent world (like mmo) is state sharable and could let players feel more immersed.
3. To make multiplicative distribution rather than transferring a single branch to new players.
   UGC game requires more system design to control the game, and platformers really need decent levels.

## Prototypes for Halves <a name="digital-prototype"></a>

After we narrow down ideas into two big categories, we begin to make the demo prototype for the incoming halves in Week 8. We all agree to make a digital prototype for the Virus vs. Cell idea for the following reasons: <br>

1.  Some ideas are hard to paper prototype, even for those paper prototype-able ones it does not wholly match the feeling we want. <br>
2.  Digital prototypes offer insights into controlling and feedback which paper prototype cannot give. <br>
3.  As the project progresses, we need to settle down on art style and hardware as our final deliverable will be a digital game, so it is good to start early exploring possible approaches for the ideas. <br>

### Game: Virus vs Cell

On the other side, we would like to make a paper prototype for the second idea for the following reasons:

1. We actually only have less than 2 weeks for the two prototypes, and we want the whole project to be on a good balance without leaving any of two prototypes behind.
2. The One Hour One Life idea is feasible for paper prototyping as its core gameplay is pretty obvious and understandable to test on paper.

### Game: One Hour One Life

## Production <a name="production"></a>

We plan to begin the actual production phase as soon as possible after the halves presentation. New problems will arise of course, but we are all feeling good to keep revising the prototypes.
